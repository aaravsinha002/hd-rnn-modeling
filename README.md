# hd-rnn-modeling
This project simulates head-direction representation in a continuous recurrent neural network (RNN), inspired by ring attractor dynamics observed in the Drosophila (fruit fly) brain. The model aims to replicate bump activity a stable, localized region of neural activation that encodes direction and investigates how different levels of injected noise affect bump stability and accuracy. Additionally, the simulation tracks a “shifter” neuron population that modulates bump movement based on angular velocity, enabling the study of anticipatory activity and potential mechanisms for error correction in navigation systems.
